# Visual Recommendations

This file contains some recommendations for improving the visual layout and styling of the application.

## General

- **Color Palette**: The current color palette is a bit muted. A more vibrant color scheme could make the application more engaging. Consider using a brighter primary color and a more contrasting accent color.
- **Typography**: The typography could be improved to create a better visual hierarchy. Consider using a larger font size for headings and a different font weight for titles to make the page easier to read and scan.
- **Layout and Spacing**: The layout is generally good, but some areas could benefit from more white space to improve readability and reduce clutter.
- **Overall Aesthetic**: The application has a clean and simple aesthetic, but it could be made more modern and professional with some subtle visual enhancements.

## `Index.jsx`

- **Improve the color scheme**: Use a more vibrant color scheme to make the page more engaging.
- **Enhance the typography**: Use a larger font size for the main heading and a different font weight for the card titles.
- **Add more visual interest to the leaderboard**: Add team logos or icons to the leaderboard to make it more engaging. Use a different background color for the top-ranked teams to highlight their position.
- **Improve the layout of the dashboard cards**: Use a more dynamic layout, such as a masonry layout, to make the page more visually interesting.
- **Add a background image or pattern**: A subtle background image or pattern could add some depth and texture to the page.

## `Standings.jsx`

- **Improve the table design**: Use alternating row colors, add more padding to the cells, and use a different font weight for the table header to make the table easier to read and more visually appealing.
- **Add visual cues for rank changes**: Add arrows or color coding to the standings table to indicate whether a team's rank has gone up, down, or stayed the same since the previous week.
- **Enhance the tabs**: Use a more modern design for the tabs, such as a different background color for the active tab or a subtle animation when switching between tabs.
- **Improve the "Select Week" component**: Use a larger font size and a more prominent dropdown arrow to make the "Select Week" component easier to use.
- **Add a visual separator**: A visual separator, such as a horizontal line or a subtle gradient, would help to visually separate the week selector from the standings table.

## `ManagerPage.jsx`

- **Improve the login form design**: Add a background image or a gradient to the login form, and use a more modern font for the title.
- **Add social login buttons**: Add social login buttons (e.g., Google, GitHub) to the login form to make it easier for users to log in.
- **Improve the layout of the manager dashboard**: Use a more organized structure, such as a grid or a multi-column layout, to improve the layout of the manager dashboard.
- **Add a welcome message**: A personalized welcome message would make the manager dashboard more engaging.

## `ImportPicks.jsx`

- **Improve the layout of the import section**: Add more spacing between the elements and use a more visually appealing design for the "Paste Poll Results" card.
- **Add a file upload option**: In addition to pasting the poll results, it would be useful to have a file upload option.
- **Improve the design of the parsed games and picks sections**: Use a card-based layout or a table with alternating row colors to improve the design of the parsed games and picks sections.
- **Add a progress bar for the saving process**: When saving the picks, a progress bar would provide a better user experience than a simple loading spinner.

## `AuthCallback.jsx`

- **Improve the visual design of the loading state**: Use a custom loading animation that is more on-brand with the application.
- **Add a background image or pattern**: A subtle background image or pattern could add some visual interest to the page and make it more engaging.
- **Use a more modern font**: Use a more modern font to give the page a more contemporary look and feel.
- **Improve the layout of the card**: Add more padding, use a different background color, and add a subtle box shadow to improve the layout of the card.
