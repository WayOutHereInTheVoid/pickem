# UI Recommendations

This file contains some recommendations for improving the user interface of the application.

## General

- **Consistency**: There are some inconsistencies in the UI, such as the use of different button styles and card layouts. It would be good to establish a consistent design system and apply it throughout the application.
- **Responsiveness**: The application is not fully responsive on all screen sizes. It would be beneficial to improve the responsiveness of the UI to ensure a good user experience on all devices.
- **Accessibility**: The accessibility of the application could be improved. For example, some elements are missing ARIA attributes, and the color contrast could be improved in some areas.

## `Index.jsx`

- **Add a loading skeleton for the leaderboard**: While the leaderboard data is loading, a skeleton screen would provide a better user experience than the "Loading scores..." text.
- **Improve the error state**: The current error state is just a simple text message. It would be better to display a more user-friendly error message, perhaps with an icon and a button to retry the action.
- **Add a "View all" button to the leaderboard**: The leaderboard currently shows only the top 5 teams. It would be useful to have a "View all" button that takes the user to the full standings page.
- **Enhance the `DashboardCard` component**: The `DashboardCard` component could be enhanced with more visual appeal. For example, a subtle hover effect or a gradient background could be added to make it more engaging.
- **Add more dashboard cards**: The dashboard currently has only one card. More cards could be added to provide quick access to other important pages, such as "Submit Picks" or "Manager Page".

## `Standings.jsx`

- **Improve the loading state**: Similar to the `Index.jsx` page, the standings page could benefit from a loading skeleton while the data is being fetched.
- **Add pagination to the tables**: If the number of participants in the league is large, the standings tables could become very long. Adding pagination to the tables would make it easier to navigate through the data.
- **Highlight the current user**: If the application had user accounts, it would be a nice feature to highlight the current user's row in the standings tables.
- **Add a search bar**: A search bar would be a useful addition to the standings page, allowing users to quickly find a specific team or participant.
- **Improve the "Export" button**: The "Export Week X Data" button could be improved by providing more feedback to the user. For example, a loading spinner could be displayed while the data is being exported, and a success message could be shown when the export is complete.

## `ManagerPage.jsx`

- **Improve the login form**: The login form is functional, but it could be improved with better error handling and visual feedback.
- **Add a "Forgot Password" link**: The login form does not have a "Forgot Password" link.
- **Improve the mobile menu**: The mobile menu is currently empty. It should contain the same navigation links as the sidebar.

## `ImportPicks.jsx`

- **Improve the parsing process**: The parsing process currently has a simulated delay. This should be replaced with the actual parsing logic and a loading spinner should be displayed.
- **Provide better feedback for parsing errors**: If the parsing fails, a more descriptive error message should be displayed to the user.
- **Improve the "Save Picks" button**: The "Save Picks" button could be improved by providing more feedback to the user, such as a loading spinner and a success message.
- **Add a confirmation dialog**: Before saving the picks, it would be a good idea to show a confirmation dialog to the user.

## `AuthCallback.jsx`

- **Improve the loading state**: The current loading state is a simple spinner and some text. This could be improved by adding a more engaging animation or a progress bar.
- **Provide more context**: The page could provide more context about what is happening, such as "You are being securely logged in...".
- **Handle errors more gracefully**: If an error occurs during the authentication process, it would be better to display the error message on the auth callback page itself, with a button to retry the login or contact support.
