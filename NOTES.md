# Notes for the Developer

This file contains some notes and suggestions for improving the codebase.

## Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling**: The error handling in the application could be improved. For example, in the `createManagerAccount` function in `ManagerAccountSetup.jsx`, the error is simply logged to the console and a generic error message is displayed to the user. It would be better to display a more specific error message based on the error that occurred.
- **Code Duplication**: There is some code duplication in the application. For example, the `AlertDialog` and `Dialog` components are very similar. It might be possible to create a more generic `Modal` component that could be used for both.
- **State Management**: The application currently uses a combination of `useState` and `useContext` for state management. For a larger application, it might be worth considering a more robust state management library like Redux or Zustand.
- **Testing**: There are no tests in the application. It would be beneficial to add unit tests for the components and utility functions, and end-to-end tests for the main user flows.

## Issues

- **Inconsistent Naming**: There are some inconsistencies in the naming of components and files. For example, some components are named in PascalCase, while others are named in kebab-case. It would be good to establish a consistent naming convention and stick to it.
- **Missing `key` prop**: In the `Standings.jsx` file, the list of players is rendered without a `key` prop. This can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior in React.
- **Hardcoded values**: There are some hardcoded values in the application that could be extracted into constants. For example, the `TOAST_LIMIT` and `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY` in `use-toast.js` could be moved to a separate configuration file.
